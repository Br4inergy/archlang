/**
 * `diffPlans(sourceA, sourceB)` — a pure, structural semantic diff of two plans.
 *
 * Where {@link import("./describe.js").describe} turns one source into *facts*, this
 * turns two sources into the *delta* between them: which rooms were added, removed,
 * resized, moved or relabeled; which doors/windows/openings appeared, vanished, changed
 * width or were re-hosted; which walls (authored or derived) came, went, moved, resized or
 * changed thickness; which furniture came and went; and the before/after plan totals. It
 * runs on top of `describe()` plus the walls and opening hosts of the same resolve
 * (`describeWithAutoIds`'s `fabric`), so it inherits the same purity, determinism and
 * never-throw contract. Every loop is one pass per element list with map lookups.
 *
 * Pure, synchronous, deterministic. It never throws on bad input: a side that fails
 * to resolve yields `{ ok: false, …empty… }`.
 *
 * Task 4 layers circulation deltas and human-readable summary sentences on top of the
 * {@link PlanDiff} returned here; those fields (`circulation`, `summary`) are present
 * but stay empty in this task. **The exported type shapes are frozen API** — ArchCanvas
 * consumes `PlanDiff` verbatim.
