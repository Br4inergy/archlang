/**
 * Print the playground permalink for an example — `#z=<base64url(deflate-raw(utf8))>`,
 * the exact codec `playground/src/share.ts` reads.
 *
 * Why this exists: GitHub's markdown sanitizer strips `<iframe>` (it renders as escaped
 * text, like `<script>`), so the playground's Embed snippet — which works fine in a blog,
 * a wiki or the docs site — CANNOT produce a live plan in the README. The closest honest
 * thing is a link that opens the real playground with the plan already loaded.
 *
 * A hand-pasted hash would rot silently: edit the example, and the README's image shows the
 * NEW plan while its link still opens the OLD one. So the links are generated here and
 * pinned by `test/readme-permalink.test.ts`, which decodes every `#z=` in README.md and
 * fails if it no longer matches the example it claims to be.
