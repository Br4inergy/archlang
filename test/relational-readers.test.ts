/**
 * Backlog PS0.5: an element that READS a relationally placed room — `furniture … against
 * wall … in <room>` (side inference), `furniture … in <room> centered|anchor`, a door's
 * `swing into <room>` and a garage door's floor probe — used to resolve while that room still
 * sat at its (0,0) placeholder, so every reader refused any room carrying `_rel`
 * (`E_FURN_AGAINST`, `E_PLACE_REF`, `W_SWING_ROOM_NOT_ADJACENT`).
 *
 * Rooms now resolve, and relational ones are placed, before every other kind (ADR 0028 §1),
 * so the readers refuse only a room that could not be placed (`_unplaced`). The law: a plan
 * whose room is placed `right-of` draws exactly what the same plan with that room written at
 * its resolved `at` draws.
